# Instrumap v0.9.5

Instrumap v0.9.5 is now live. If you have already bought a license it is already in your Gumroad account (along with all the older versions). Anyone new can also download it here and use it in demo mode before you purchase.

This is a relatively small update (compared to v0.9.4), the main things are:

* improved sample recognition:
  * _Micro Moog from Mars_ and _Arp Omni from Mars_ now detected and correctly mapped
  * PureMagnetik's _Phaseform vol 2_ now maps to correct pitches
* lower note support: previously Instrumap didn't recognise notes below below C-1 but now goes all the way down to C-2 (thanks Terrel for reporting this!)
* **demo mode:** you can download and try Instrumap for free (but limited to only saving out 20 files - should be enough to convert most sample packs and get a sense of it)

That's it!
